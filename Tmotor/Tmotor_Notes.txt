For AK series the gearboxes are made up because these actually come in an 
integrated module. 

The motor inertia is not given so it is estimated from motors with similar 
parameters. No load speeds are estimated visually  from the supplied graphs and
multiplied by the reduction ratios. Nominal torques are given from the continuous
torque on the plot divided by the gearbox ratio and torque constant (same as rated current).
The computed no load current would be negative for the AK motors so an arbitrary
value of 0.1 A is being used.
If anyone has measurements that would be greatly appreciated. 


For AK60_6 and AK80_6, motor inertia estimated from published values for U8 KV100
